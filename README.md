# _Pierre's Vendor & Order Tracker_

#### _Console application written in C# that allows a bakery owner to track their Vendors and Orders_

#### By _**Nathan Schrader**_

## Description
This console application was developed in my 9th week at Epicodus Coding School. It is written in C# with a Model-View-Controller design pattern. The emphasis of this independent project was on implementing custom Classes and Namespaces, auto-implemented Properties, GET and POST requests/responses, and MVC routes that follow RESTful conventions.

This MVC application allows a bakery owner, Pierre, to track vendors that purchase baked goods from him, and to add orders belonging to those vendors.
